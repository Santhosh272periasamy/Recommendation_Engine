# **Recommendation Engines in NLP**

### **Introduction:**

A Recommendation System is an algorithm that suggests items to users based on their preferences or behaviors.  
Applications such as Movies (Netflix) , Products (Amazon) , Songs (Spotify) , News articles , Job listings, friends (LinkedIn/Facebook)

### **Types of Recommendation Algorithms:**

* Content-Based Filtering  
* Collaborative Filtering  
  * User-Based Collaborative Filtering  
  * Item-Based Collaborative Filtering  
* Hybrid Recommendation


### **1\. Content-Based Filtering:**

Recommends items similar to what the user liked in the past.  
Consider an example If you liked "Inception", the system might recommend "Interstellar" (both are sci-fi).

### **How it works**:

* Uses **item features** (e.g., genre, keywords, description)  
* Creates a **profile of user preferences**  
* Recommends based on **similarity**

### **2\. Collaborative Filtering:**

Recommends items based on what similar users liked.

There are two subtypes:

### **a) User-Based Collaborative Filtering:**

Find users similar to you and Recommend items they liked.

Example:   
“If User A and B both liked 5 similar movies, and User B liked Movie X, then recommend X to User A.”

### **b) Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:**

Find items similar to what you liked and Recommend those to you

**Example:**  
	“People who bought this also bought that.”

### **3\. Hybrid Recommendation:**

Combines content-based and collaborative filtering.

Example:  
Netflix uses: Content of movies , Ratings from similar users , Genre \+ Watch time \+ History

### **Similarity Metrics Used:**

* Cosine Similarity  
* Pearson Correlation  
* Jaccard Similarity  
* Euclidean Distance

**Cosine similarity** is indeed one of the **most widely used similarity measures** in recommendation systems — but whether it's suitable for **all cases** depends on **how your data is structured** and **what type of recommendation system you're building**.

We also have advanced techniques to solve this like:

* Matrix Factorization (SVD, ALS)  
* Deep Learning Approaches  
* Graph-Based Recommendations  
* Reinforcement Learning in recommender systems

###  **Evaluation Metrics:**

* **Precision**, **Recall**  
* **F1-Score**  
* **MAP** (Mean Average Precision)  
* **NDCG** (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)  
* **RMSE/MAE** for rating predictions  
* Offline vs Online evaluation (A/B Testing)

### **Conclution:**

 Recommendation engines play a crucial role in enhancing user experience in almost every modern platform we interact with. Understanding the fundamentals from content-based to deep learning methods  provides a strong foundation for both academic and industry projects.
